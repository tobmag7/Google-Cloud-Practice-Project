# LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

## Objectives:

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

	-Initialize App Engine.

	-Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

	-Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.


## Procedures:

1. Initialize App Engine.
	a. Run command in cloud shell:
		gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

	b. Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
		git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

	c. Then navigate to the source directory:
		cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world	


2. Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

	a. Run the following command in Cloud Shell command prompt to download and update the packages list:
		sudo apt-get update

	b. Set up a virtual environment to run your application:
		sudo apt-get install virtualenv 
		y 
		virtualenv -p python3 venv

	c. Activate the virtual environment:
		source venv/bin/activate


	d. Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies:
		pip install  -r requirements.txt


	e. Run the application:
		python main.py

	f. Use Web Preview to view your application on port 8080:
		Result: Hello World!

	g. To end the test and return to Cloud Shell:
		Ctrl+C


3. Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

	a. Navigate to the source directory:
		cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

	b. Deploy your Hello World application:
		gcloud app deploy

	c. To view the app, launch browser at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com:
		gcloud app browse	

	d. Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window:
		Result: Hello World!
